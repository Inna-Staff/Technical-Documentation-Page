        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web
          browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as
          complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap,
          or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a
          certain way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to
          another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the
          following line of text: <br />
          <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph element: <br />
          <code> &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt; </code>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element,
            wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag
            marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
          </li>
          <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element.</li>
          <li>
            <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except
            that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks
            where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common
            beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
          </li>
          <p>
            The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the
            closing tag.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't
          appear in the content.
        </p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more
            than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces
            too.)
          </li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>
            An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <p>
          Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's
          examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>: The doctype. When HTML was young
            (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules
            that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More
            recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be
            included for everything else to work right.
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code> is the shortest string of
            characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to
            know!
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code><code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The
            <code>&lt;html &gt;</code>element. This element wraps all the
            content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code><code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The
            <code>&lt;head &gt;</code>
            element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to
            include on the HTML page, <b>that isn't the content</b> the page
            will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description
            that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character
            set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the
            next article of the series.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>: The
            <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element. This element represents metadata
            that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like
            <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. The <code>charset</code> attribute
            specifies the character encoding for your document as UTF-8, which
            includes most characters from the vast majority of human written
            languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual
            content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it
            can help avoid some problems later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code><code>&lt;/title&gt;</code>: The
            <code>title </code> element. This sets the title of the page, which
            is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.
            The page title is also used to describe the page when it is
            bookmarked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code><code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>: The
            <code>body</code> element. This contains all the content that
            displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games,
            playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
        <header>HTML comments</header>
        <p>
          HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore
          comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code
          to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to
          a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely
          remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are
          making changes and updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers
          <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>.
        </p>
